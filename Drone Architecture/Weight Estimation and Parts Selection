The frame was designed keeping in mind, the components to be housed, the size and weight of theUAV. It belongs to the micro quad category and measures 250mm*250mm*150mm. The materialused to fabricate the frame was PLA. The total weight of the frame stood at 178g, whichcontributed to approximately 15% of the overall weight of the system. This is in accordance with the design rules.

The overall weight is calculated in order to make correct assumptions regarding the total thrust required and the selection of motor propeller combinations.

Component Weight (in grams)
Frame 178
Companion Computer 48
Li-Po Battery 491
Flight Controller 42
Electronic Speed Controller * 4 52
Intel T265 Tracking Camera 73
Motor + Propellers * 4 320
Total Weight = 1204 grams.

Approximate thrust required = 2 * the total weight = 2500g thrust.

For our purpose, we have chosen the DYS Samguk Series WU 2206 Brushless Motor rated at 2400KV, that provides 680g thrust per motor when supplied with 11.1V with a 5045 tri-blade propeller. Therefore, we obtain a maximum thrust of 2720g, which is a good value leaving adequate margins for errors.
